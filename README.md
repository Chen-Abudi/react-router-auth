- React Router Dom v6
- JavaScript
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- CSS Modules

## 🛠️ Techniques:

- Authentication
- **_Validate_** user input and **_Handle Validation Errors_**
- **_redirect_**: When returning or throwing responses in loaders and actions, we can use redirect to redirect to another route.

  **`Note`**: It's recommended to use redirect in loaders and actions rather than useNavigate in your components when the redirect is in response to data.

- **`React Router Dom Hooks`**:

  - **_useRouteLoaderData_**: Is a hook that efficiently manages loading states and data for specific routes. It optimizes rendering by fetching data only when needed, enhancing user experience.
  - **_useRouteError_**: Is a hook that returns anything during an action, loader, or rendering inside of an **errorElement**.
  - **_useNavigation_**: Is a hook that provides imperative navigation capabilities. It allows to programmatically navigate to different routes, pass state, and control navigation history, enhancing dynamic routing and user experience management.
